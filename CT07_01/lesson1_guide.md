# Lesson 1 - Recap on Problem-Solving Tools and
#            Techniques

## Task 1: The first run
1. Go to replit and click on the file "main.py"
2. Run the program by clicking on the "Run" button.
3. What do you see in the "Console" on the right side?

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 2: Change main.py to run lesson1.py file
All replit projects run from main.py.
1. Comment the line that says:
   **print("Hello from main.py")**
2. Uncomment the line that says
   **from CT07_01 import lesson1.py**

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Recap 1: Pseudocode (Recycling logic)
Task: Write down the steps on how to solve the problem below

Design pseudocode for a recycling robot that sorts items
into bins for glass, plastic, and paper. The robot should
check each item's material and place it in the correct bin.

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Recap 2: Variables & Mind map
Use mindmap to think about the number of variables you need for
the following. Then, create a program that does the following:

You just had lunch at a sushi restaurant and have to calculate
the total amount you have spent. Different coloured plates
costs different as shown below:

Red = $1
Blue = $2
Green = $3

You have ordered a total of 3 red plates, 5 blue plates,
and 4 green plates. Calculate and print the total amount you
have spent:

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Recap 3: Debugging Average Score Program
There is a total of 3 bugs in the following program.
Identify and fix the bugs:

score_one = 80
score_two = 90
score_three = 75

total = score_one + score_two score_three

average_score = totl / 3

student_name = "Alex"

print("Average score for " + student_name + " is: " + average_score)

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Recap 4: If..elif..else & Flowchart
Write a program that asks the user to input a score
(as an integer) and then assigns a grade based on that score.
Use the following grading scheme:

If the score is 75 or higher, the grade is 'A'.
If the score is between 60 and 74 (inclusive), the grade is 'B'.
If the score is between 50 and 59 (inclusive), the grade is 'C'.
Any score below 50 will be graded as 'Fail'.

Use flowchart to draw out all decisions that are to be made
before starting on your code.
